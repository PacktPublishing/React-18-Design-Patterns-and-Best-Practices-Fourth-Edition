This is the code repository for [React-18-Design-Patterns-and-Best-Practices-Fouth-Edition](https://www.amazon.com/React-Design-Patterns-Best-Practices/dp/1803233109), published by Packt.

**Design, build, and deploy production-ready web applications with React by leveraging industry-best practices**

## About the book

React helps you work smarter, not harder — but to reap the benefits of this popular JavaScript library and its components, you need a straightforward guide that will teach you how to make the most of it.

React 18 Design Patterns and Best Practices will help you use React effectively to make your applications more flexible, easier to maintain, and improve their performance, while giving your workflow a huge boost. With a better organization of topics and knowledge about best practices added to your developer toolbox, the updated fourth edition ensures an enhanced learning experience.

The book is split into three parts; the first will teach you the fundamentals of React patterns, the second will dive into how React works, and the third will focus on real-world applications. All the code samples are updated to the latest version of React and you’ll also find plenty of new additions that explore React 18 and Node 19’s newest features, alongside MonoRepo Architecture and a dedicated chapter on TypeScript.

By the end of this book, you'll be able to efficiently build and deploy real-world React web applications.
